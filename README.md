# Link Manager Web Application

**Created by Dependra Singh**

## Introduction
This website is a full-stack Link Manager and Affiliate Analytics application developed by Dependra Singh. It was created to help users efficiently generate, manage, and track affiliate links and bookmarks in one secure place. Users can create affiliate links, share them across different platforms (such as social media, messaging apps, or websites), and monitor their performance. The motivation behind building this project was to provide a modern, user-friendly solution for both personal and professional link management, with advanced features such as notifications, analytics, and a credit/payment system.

## Why This Project Was Made
Managing and promoting affiliate links or business campaigns across multiple platforms can be challenging. Users need to know which channels are most effective for their growth. This project was made to address these needs by providing:
- Secure user authentication and data storage
- Easy generation and organization of affiliate links
- Ability to share links to various platforms
- Real-time notifications and milestone tracking
- Integrated credit and payment system for premium features
- Detailed analytics (such as click stats) to help users understand which platforms drive the most engagement and growth

## Scope
The Link Manager is designed for both individual and organizational use. It supports:
- Personal and business affiliate link management
- Team or group resource sharing (extensible)
- Credit-based premium features and payments
- In-app notifications for important events (e.g., link milestones)
- Analytics and statistics for link performance, including platform-specific click tracking
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements (e.g., integrations, sharing, more analytics)

## Features

### Project Cleanup

Legacy and test scripts (e.g., test-api.js, test-payment.js, test-destination-analytics.js, test-tracking.html, simple-test.js, update-existing-links.js) have been removed for clarity and maintainability. The project now only contains production and documentation files.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mern-link-manager
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `config.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/link-manager
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=5000
```

**Note**: Replace the values with your actual configuration:
- `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: A strong secret key for JWT token signing
- `CLIENT_URL`: Your frontend URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `PORT`: Backend server port (default: 5000)
- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: Email service provider (default: gmail)
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address
